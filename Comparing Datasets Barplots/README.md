# Comparing Datasets
After the generation of several CSVs from the CellSize_main.ipynb, you can compare the results of these datasets using CellSize_Multiple_CSVs.ipynb

## Instructions for use
1. After the generation of .CSVs from the CellSize_main.ipynb, each csv file can be added to this notebook with their corresponding labels.
2. The ccode will generate Means and Standard deviations for the following features: Length, Width, Area, and Aspect Ratio.
3. Output will generate barplots with each labeled datset and save them to the working folder.
